To run this:

clone the repo
Then in that folder on your terminal, run "npm install". Which will install the needed dependencies.

NOTICE: sometimes you may need to run "npm install" after making changes, or pulling from github to get the code to run

Then run "nodemon app.js" or "node app.js" depending on if you have nodemon or not.
